The University of St Andrews Table Tennis club is a student run table tennis club within the University of St Andrews. The club is open to all students and staff at the university and meets every Sunday in the University Sports Hall from 6:30-9pm.

For players looking to play competitive table tennis, the club competes at the highest level of student sport within the UK competing in the Scottish Student Sport Co(SSS) league and the British University and Colleges Sport (BUCS) league. We run regular training sessions for these players and invite coaches to come along to train players to improve.
